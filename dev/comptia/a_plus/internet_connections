        - different speeds of download and upload
        - max download was about 8 Mbps
        - max upload was about 1.544 Mbps
        - maximizes the download and minimizes the uploads
    - Symmetric DSL (SDSL)
        - has equal speeds of download and upload
    - Very High Bit-Rate DSL (VDSL)
        - has high speeds of download and upload
        - download of 50 Mbps or more
        - upload of 10 Mbps or more

    - uses a cable TV network that is made up of a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) distribution network
    - transmit and receive over cable television infrastructure

Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS)
    - specific frequency ranges used for upstream and downstream transmissions
    - upstream 5 MHz to 42 MHz
    - downstream 50 MHz to 860 MHz

Fiber Connections
-----------------
