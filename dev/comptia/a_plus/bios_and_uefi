Basic Input Output System (BIOS)
- older version
- only supports 32-bit processors and motherboards
- program that a CPU uses to start the computer system after being turned on
- method for configuring the motherboard using a text-based interface
- stored as firmware on the motherboard
- Power-on self-test
    - test an initialize the:
        - processor
        - video card
        - disk drives
        - adapters
- hardware configuration
- boot order setup
- stored in read-only memory (ROM)
    - type of chip embedded in the motherboard and can be upgraded through flashing
- settings are stored saved in the CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)
    - battery powered memory chip
    - non-volatile memory
    - store BIOS settings
    - built into motherboard
    - as long as the battery has power, the settings will be maintained
- only supports Master Boot Record (MBR)
    - storage device partition table

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
- supports 64-bit processors
- provides a GUI
- stored as firmware on the motherboard
- supports larger HDDs and SSDs
    - (9.4 zettabytes ~ 9.4 * 10^21 bytes)
- supports the new GUID Partition Table (GPT) format
- faster boot-up
- uses a larger ROM size


Boot Options
------------

boot process:
1. Power-On Self-Test (POST)
    - diagnostic testing sequence to check the computer's basic input/output system
    - check's computer's:
        - keyboard
        - RAM
        - disk drives
        - storage devices
        - and other hardware
    - if everything is detected and operating properly, the computer can begin to boot up
    - if hardware is not detected or not operating properly, the BIOS will issue an error message
        - since the post runs before the video card is activated, it may not be possible to display everything to the screen. So, variable beeps are used to tell what's wrong
2. BIOS reads settings from the CMOS and the BIOS will look for an operating system from the configured boot devices
    - the BIOS has a low-level OS which allows it to take input and give output to the basic components including the:
        - keyboard
        - disk drives
        - video display
    - turns control over to operating system

For safety, corporate environments will have booting from an optical drive or USB drive disabled, because if someone has physical access to your machine, they could boot into a different OS and access your system without needing to know your particular OS's login credentials.

To upgrade the BIOS and UEFI, you perform flashing.
- performed during upgrades, security fixes, or feature improvements

BIOS/UEFI Security
------------------

- Supervisor/Administrator/Setup Password
    - used to protect access to the BIOS or UEFI configuration program and prevents access from unauthorized users
    - does not prevent booting to the OS
- User/System Password
    - used to lock access to the computer
- Storage/Hard Drive Password
    - password that locks access to a hard drive connected to the system and requires the end user's password
- Secure Boot
    - enabled in the UEFI interface and settings and is not supported by BIOS
    - performs three checks
    - has to be enabled inside UEFI
    - OS has to support it
- setting up permissions for the USB ports on the motherboard
    - most modern systems can be configured to enable or disable the USB ports on the motherboard

TPM and HSM
-----------

Hardware Root of Trust (RoT) is the foundation of all secure operations of a computing system.
    - cryptographic module embedded in a computer system that endorses trusted execution and attests to boot settings and metrics
    - used to scan the boot metrics in the OS files to verify signatures and then use them to sign the report
    - contains keys used for cryptographic functions
    - enables the secure boot process
    - it is inherently trusted and so it must be secure by design
    - TPM is a hardware RoT

Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
    - most common hardware RoT
    - specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information
    - hardcoded with unique and unchageable key that's called the endorsement key (EK)
    - ensures the system have not been tampered with:
        - firmware
        - boot loader
        - OS kernel

Hardware Security Module (HSM)
    - appliance for generating and storing cryptographic keys that is less susceptible to tampering and insider threats

BIOS/UEFI Cooling Options

BIOS and UEFI have the ability to configure fans.
