bit uses ``b``
byte uses ``B`` 

1,000,000 bits  = 1 Megabit  (Mb)
1,000,000 bytes = 1 Megabyte (MB)

1,000,000,000 bits  = 1 Gigabit  (Gb)
1,000,000,000 bytes = 1 Gigabyte (GB)

USB Cables (Universal Serial Bus)
---------------------------------

Firstly, these were designed to replace serial cables which would be connected to a computer using a DB9 (most common) or DB25 connector

DB9 Connector: D-shaped sub-miniature pin at the back of a computer. It also had two thumb screws to screw the serial cable into the serial port on the back
               of a computer's motherboard. They were called serial because the data was set in a straight line, one bit at a time. The important thing to
               know about these is that you could only have one device plugged into one serial port.

With USB, you can connect up to 127 devices to a single port using something called a daisy-chain. This doesn't work in practice though because the host controller (which controls the port), uses the same amount of bandwidth for all devices in a port.

Longer cables have higher chances of resistance and speed and signal deterioration

In addition to data transfer, USB can also provide power to devices. The amount of power is determined by the type of port

USB 1.0/USB 2.0
500 milliamps or 0.5 amsp

USB 3.0
900 milliamps or 0.9 amps

Powered Device (PD) Port
1500 milliamps or 1.5 amps (7.5 W)

There are different types of connectors.
USB Type A: flat rectangular connector that allows to insert the USB cable in only one direction. Very common in desktops and laptops.
USB Type C: Came out with USB 3 and beyond. You can insert the cable in either direction.
USB Type B:
    - Type B: Usually on larger devices such as printers. More of a square shaped port with the top corners cut off so it can only be inserted in one direction
    - Type B mini: almost like a trapezoid. Found on early tablets and smartphones but most have switched to type C.
    - Type B micro: shorter and skinnier than type B mini. Normally used on small devices like wearables such as smart glasses and smart watches as well as small music players
USB Micro B Super Speed (for USB 3): Looks like a figure 8. typically used on the back of portable storage devices.
