Network Configurations
----------------------

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
    - communication across LAN or WAN
    - 4 layers
        1. Link/Network Interface Layer
            - responsible for putting frames in the physical network's transmission media. this media could be a
                - copper twisted pair cable
                - fiber optic cable
                - radio waves
            - data can only travel through the local area network
        2. Internet Layer
            - used to adress packets and route them across the network
            - where Internet Protocol (IP) enters the discussion
        3. Transport Layer
            - shows how to send the packets
                - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                    - guaranteed connection oriented method of sending packets from one device to another over the network
                    - slower than UDP
                - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
                    - connectionless protocol, so lower overhead, making it faster than TCP
                    - delivery is not guaranteed like with TCP
        4. Application Layer
            - contains all the protocols that perform higher-level functions

IPv4
----

- most common type of IP addressing
    - examples
        - 10.1.2.3
        - 172.21.243.67
    - dotted-decimal notation
    - each number is called an octet because it represents an 8-bit number (0 - 255)
