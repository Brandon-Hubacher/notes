Virtualization
--------------

Host computer installed with a hypervisor that can be used to install and manage multiple guest operating systems or virtual machines (VMs)

Hardware is referred to as bare metal

          Type I                         Type II

Bare metal hypervisor that      Hypervisor runs on top of
runs directly on the            operating system
hardward and functions as
the operating system
- Hyper-V                       - VMWare Workstation
- Zen Server                    - VirtualBox
- ESXi
- VSphere

2 models to provide virtualized application services:
1. Server-based (terminal services)
    - server-based solution that runs the application on servers in a centralized location
2. Client-based (application streaming)
    - client-based solution that allows an application to be packaged up and streamed directly to a user's PC

Containerization
----------------

Operating system's kernel is shared across multiple VMs but the user space for each VM is uniquely created and managed
Containerization is a type of virtualization applied by a host operating system to provision an isolated execution environment for an application

1. When a physical server crashes, all the organizations hosted on that same server are affected
2. An organization's failure to secure the virtual environments hosted on a shared server poses a security risk for the other organizations
3. Hosting all VMs on the same type of hypervisor can also be exploited

Purposes of VMs
---------------

Hypervisor: manages the distribution of the physical resources of a server to the virtual machines

Hyperconverged Infrastructure: allows for the full integration of the storage, network, and servers without hardware changes

Application Virtualization: Encapsulates computer programs from the underlying OS on which they are executed

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): Hosts desktop OSs within a virtualized environment hosted by a centralized server or server farm
    - really cool example where employee's operating system was virtualized such that each every time they logged off it was destroyed (or at midnight) making it difficult for attacker's to remain persistent on the user's desktop

Sandbox: an isolated environment for analyzing pieces of malware

Cross-Platform Virtualization: allows for the testing and running of software applications for different operating systems

Set up virtual servers in the cloud with proper failover, redundancy, and elasticity

Emulation
=========

System imitating another system

Resource Requirements
---------------------

4 main areas of focus:
1. CPU and its virtualization extensions
    - Intel uses VT-x
    - AMD uses AMD-V
    - There's also Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
        - improves the performance of virtual memory when running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host
        - Intel calls this Extended Page Table (EPT)
        - AMD calls this Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI)
2. System memory
    - Amount of physical memory installed on a physical server
3. Storage
4. Networking

NIC teaming configuration allows multiple cards for higher speeds

Security Requirements
---------------------

VM Escape
=========

Threat attempts to get out of an isolated VM and send commands to the underlying hypervisor
Easier to perform on a type II hypervisor than a type I hypervisor

For protection ensure that your guest OS, host OS, and hypervisor are patched and up-to-date

VM Hopping
==========

Threat attempts to move from one VM to another on the same host

For protection ensure that your guest OS, host OS, and hypervisor are patched, up-to-date, and securely configured

Sandbox Escape
==============

A sandbox separates running processes and programs to mitigate system failures or software vulnerabilities
The escape occurs when an attacker circumvents sandbox protections to gain access to the protected OS or other privileged processes

For protection ensure that your guest OS, host OS, and hypervisor are patched, up-to-date, have strong edpoint software protection, and have limited extensions or add-ons

Other Topics
============

A live migration migrates the virtual machine from one host to another while its running
Because a live migration occurs over the network, ensure that live migration only occurs on a trusted network or utilizes encryption

Data remnants are leftover pieces of data that may exist in the hard drive which are no longer needed
    - encrypt virtual machine storage location
    - destroy encryption key

VM sprawl is the uncontrolled deployment of virtual machines

Configuring Virtual Machines

Securing Virtual Machines
-------------------------

- Use disk encryption of for VM
- Don't share folders between host OS and guest OS
