1. Identify the problem
    - gather information from the user
    - identify user changes
    - make backups before making any changes
    - ask if there have been any environmental or infrastructure changes recently
2. Establish a theory of probable cause
    - immediately consider things that are obvious and easy to check
        - for example, if a workstation is not powering on
            - make sure it is plugged to the wall outlet properly
            - make sure the outlet has power
3. Test the theory to determine the cause
    - in our workstation example, if your theory is that the outlet is faulty, try plugging the workstation in to a different outlet
    - if the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
    - our plan of action would be to replace the outlet
    - the solution to implement that would be to buy and replace the outlet or put in a work order so a professional can replace it
5. Verify full system functionality and if applicable, implement preventative measures
6. Document the findings, actions, and outcome
