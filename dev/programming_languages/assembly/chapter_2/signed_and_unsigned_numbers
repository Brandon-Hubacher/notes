2^n unsigned numbers
-2^(n - 1) to +2^(n - 1) - 1 signed numbers

The x86-64 microprocessor uses the two's complement notation to represent signed numbers. The HO (leftmost) bit is a
sign bit.
Sign bit == 1 == number is negative
Sign bit == 0 == number is positive

Algorithm to convert a positive number to its negative, two's complement form
=============================================================================

1. Invert all the bits in the number; that is, apply the logical NOT function
2. Add 1 to the inverted result and ignore any carry out of the HO bit

You can use the neg (negate) instruction

```
neg dest
```

which is equivalent to:

    dest = -dest;
