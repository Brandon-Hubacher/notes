Binary Conventions
------------------

The rightmost bit is bit position 0.
So, an 8-bit binary number could be represented as:

    X_7 X_6 X_5 X_4 X_3 X_2 X_1 X_0

Bit 0 is called the low-order (LO) bit and is sometimes referred to as the least significant bit.
The leftmost bit is the high-order (HO) bit and is sometimes referred to as the most significant bit.

Hexadecimal
-----------

Most engineers use the hexadecimal numbering system because it:
    - is more compact than binary
    - is more simple to convert to binary than decimal

The radix, as you could imagine, is 16.

1234_16 is equal to:

    (1 x 16^3) + (2 x 16^2) + (3 x 16^1) + (4 x 16^0)
    4096       + 512        + 48         + 4
    4660_10

The digits used in hexadecimal are as follows:

    hexadecimal |    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    A    B    C    D    E    F
    ------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    decimal     |    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15

Because most computer systems don't have the ability to write a subscript to denote the radix, we need a different
mechanism for representing hexadecimal numbers. The following is what MASM uses:

    1. All hexadecimal values begin with a numeric character (0-9) and have an ``h`` suffix
        - 123A4h
        - 0DEADh
    2. Binary values have a ``b`` suffix
        - 10010b
    3. Decimal numbers do not have a suffix

The hexadecimal radix (16) is 4 times as large as the binary radix (2). Consequently, it takes 4 bits to represent the
largest hexadecimal digit (16 == 1111). So, when converting binary to hexadecimal, each chunk of 4 bits corresponds to
a single hexadecimal digit. The following table is everything you need to know:
