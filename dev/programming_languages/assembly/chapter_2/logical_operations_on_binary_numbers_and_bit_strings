Using the logical AND, OR, and XOR operations to manipulate bit strings is known as masking bit strings.

and, or, and xor have the same syntax as add and sub instructions:

```
and dest, source
or  dest, source
xor dest, source
```

Which is equivalent to:

    dest = dest operator source


The not instruction has the following form:

```
not dest
```

Which is equivalent to:

    dest = not(dest)
