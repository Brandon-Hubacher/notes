Single-Precision Format
-----------------------

- one's complement 24-bit mantissa
- 8-bit excess-127 exponent
- single sign bit

The mantissa usually represents a value from 1.0 to just under 2.0.
The HO bit of the mantissa is always assumed to be 1 and represents a value just to the left of the binary point (the
binary equivalent of the decimal point).

Because the HO bit is always assumed to be 1, it isn't stored.
There are an infinite number of values between 1 and 2 but we can only represent 8 million of them because we use a
23-bit mantissa (with the implied 24th bit always 1), hence the innaccuracy in floating-point arithmetic.

The 24-bit mantissa is an unsigned binary number and the sign bit determines whether the value is positive or negative.
One's complement has the unusual property that there are two representations for 0:
    - one with the sign bit set
    - one with the sign bit clear

We will assume that 0 always has the sign bit clear

The exponent portion comes into play when you want to represent values outside the range 1.0 to just under 2.0.
The format raises 2 to the power specified by the exponent and then multiplies the mantissa by this value.
The exponent is 8 bits and is stored in an excess-127 format.
    - 0 is represented by the value 127 (7Fh)
    - negatives are in the range 0 - 126
    - positives are in the range 128 - 255

To convert an exponent to excess-127 format, simply add 127.
This format makes it easier to compare floating-point values.

        The 23rd bit is the implied always 1

You get approximately 6 and a half decimal digits of precision.
Half a digit of precision means taht the first six can all be in the range 0 to 9 but the seventh digit can only be in
the range 0 to x where x < 9 and is generally close to 5.
The dynamic range is approximately 2^(+- 127)
The dynamic range is the difference in size between the smallest and largest positive values

Double-Precision Format
-----------------------

- 64 bits
- 11-bit excess-1023 exponent
- 53-bit mantissa (with implied HO bit of 1)
- plus a sign bit
- dynamic range of about 10^(+- 308)
- 14.5 digits of precision

Extended-Precision Format
-------------------------

- 80 bits
- 64-bit mantissa
- 15-bit excess-16383 exponent
- sign bit
- There is no implied HO bit

Normalized Floating-Point Values
--------------------------------

Normalized values are used to maintain maximum precision during computation.

HO mantissa bit contains 1.

Almost any non-normalized value can be normalized: just shift the mantissa bits to the left while decrementing the
exponent by one until a 1 bit is in the HO mantissa bit contains 1.

There are two important cases were a number can't be normalized
1. 0, because there are no 1s. However, this isn't an issue because it's value can be represented exactly with 1 bit
2. There are some HO bits in the mantissa that are 0 but the exponent is also 0 and so we can't decrement it.
   Denormalized values are used in their place. These do however offer less precision

Non-Numeric Values
------------------

- -infinity
- +infinity
- not-a-number (NaN)

For all of these the exponent field is filled with all 1 bits

If the exponent is all 1 bits and the mantissa all 0 bits, then the value is infinity.
- sign bit of 1 for -infinity
- sign bit of 0 for +infinity

If the exponent is all 1 bits and the mantissa is not all 0 zero bits, then the value is an invalid number (NaN)

MASM Support for Floating-Point Values
--------------------------------------

Floating point constants allow the following system:
    - An optional + or - symbol, denoting the sign of the mantissa
    - followed by one or more decimal digits
    - followed by a decimal point and zero or more decimal digits
    - optionally followed by an ``e`` or ``E``, optionally followed by a sign (+ or -) and one or more decimal digits
