There are special locations in the CPU called registers that are used to manipulate data.
The x86-64 CPUs can be broken down into 4 categories:
1. general purpose registers
2. special-purpose application-accessible registers
3. segment registers (not used much in 64-bit operating systems)
4. special-purpose kernel-mode registers

The <name_one>|<name_two> syntax means <name_one> refers to bits 0-15

There are 16 64-bit registers.

................................................................

There are 8 floating-point registers implemented in the x87 floating-point unit (FPU) named ST(0) to ST(7).
Each register is 80 bits wide, holding an extended-precision real value.

The RFLAGS (or just FLAGS) register is a 64-bit register that encapsulates several single-bit boolean values.
Most are reserved for kernel mode or are of little interest to application programmers.
8 of these are of interest to application programmers

                                              |
      carry ----------------------------------

The overflow, carry, sign, zero, and parity flags are collectively called the condition codes and can be used to test
the result of a previous computation.

Although these registers are called general purpose registers, they cannot all be used for any purpose: such as how rsp is the stack pointer.
