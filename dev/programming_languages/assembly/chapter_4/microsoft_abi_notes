- Fields of an array must be aligned on their natural size
    - the offset from the beginning of the structure to a given field must be a multiple of the field's size
- Additionally, the whole structure must be aligned at a memory address that is a multiple of the size of the largest
  object in the structure (up to 16 bytes)
- Finally, the entire structure's size must be a multiple of the largest element in the structure
    - you must add padding bytes to the end of the structure if needed
- The above only applies to passing an array or struct to another language
