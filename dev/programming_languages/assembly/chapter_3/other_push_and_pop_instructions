pushf
pushfq
popf
popfq

These push and pop the RFLAGS register which allow you to preserve condition code and other flag settings.
Pushes and pops does so with all the flags, you can't push/pop individual flags.

You should really use the pushfq and popfq instructions to push the full 64-bit version of the RFLAGS register (rather
than only the 16-bit RFLAGs portion). Although the extra 48 bits are essentially ignored when writing applications, you
want to keep the stack aligned.
