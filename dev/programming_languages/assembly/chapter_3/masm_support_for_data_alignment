You can organize your variable declarations in the source code to try and make sure the data is aligned properly, but
this makes the code more difficult to read as variables likely won't be grouped by their intent. So...

MASM provides the ``align`` directive::

    align integer_constant

where ``integer_constant`` must be one of the following small unsigned integer values:
    1, 2, 4, 8, 16

The size of your program will increase due to the padding used to align data but it will run faster.
A general rule to have the fastest possible access is to align the value with a value equal to the size of the object
you want to align.

The cache architecture of modern x86-64 CPUs handles most misaligned data so you should only concern yourself with
aligning variables for which quick access is absolutely critical.
