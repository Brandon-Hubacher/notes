1. Always pop values in the reverse order that you push them (if you wish to preserve the register's as the were before)
2. Always pop exactly the same number of bytes that you push
3. The Microsoft ABI requires the stack to be aligned on a 16-byte boundary
    - make sure this is the case before calling any functions or procedures that adhere to the Microsoft ABI
