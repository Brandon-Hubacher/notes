little-endian: LO byte stored at the lowest address and HO byte at the highest address
big-endian:    HO byte stored at the lowest address and LO byte at the highest address

For 16-bit values you can convert big-endian to little-endian with::

    xchg reg, reg
    xchg reg, mem

where reg is any 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit general-purpose register and mem is any appropriate memory location.
The operands must be the same size.

Use ``bswap`` (byte swap) for larger registers
