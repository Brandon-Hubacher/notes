- is a preprocessor directive (statement)
- ``#include <stdio.h>``
- similar to the import statement in Java

Header Files
------------

- define information about some of the functions that are provided by that file
- header file names are case sensitive on some systems so you should always write in them lowercase
- two ways to include headers files in a program
    1. using angle brackets ``#include <something.h>``
        - tells the preprocessor to look for the file in one or more standard system directories
    2. using double quotes ``#include "something.h"``
        - tells the preprocessor to first look in the current directory
