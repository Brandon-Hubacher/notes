Because an array is a contiguous sequence of memory, you increment and decrement a pointer to iterate over the elements of an array.

int arr[3];
int * ptr1, * ptr2;

=====                =======

ptr1++;              arr++;
ptr2 = ptr1 + 2;     ptr2 = ptr2 + ptr1;
ptr2 = arr + 1;      ptr2 = arr * ptr1;

When you increment a pointer to traverse an array, you don't need to worry about the size of the type of each element in the array, the compiler will handle that for you.
For example, an array of ints and array of longs can be traversed by incrementing a pointer by one even though more bytes separate the addresses in the long array than the int array.
