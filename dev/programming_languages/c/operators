sizeof
------

Find out how many bytes are occupied in memory by a given type.
Though it looks like a function, it is actually an operator because it is evaluated at compile time (unless a variable-length array is used in its argument)
The argument can be a:
- variable
- array name
- name of basic data type
- name of derived data type
- expression

asterisk ``*``
--------------

Represents a pointer to a variable.
